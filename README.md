# MNIST-Classifier-Kaggle
## Achieve 99+ accuracy with a small model in Keras

Please note that I'll be refurbishing the existing code
and/or adding new code soon. This is just an initial dump.

One more thing, the dataset used for this project is not,
and most likely will not be provided within this repo.
But you can find it at Kaggle, ofcourse.
